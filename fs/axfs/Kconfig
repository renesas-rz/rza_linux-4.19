	  The Advanced XIP File System or (AXFS) is a highly compressed
	  readonly filesystem like cramfs or squashfs.  It also can be
	  configured to store individual pages of files compressed or
	  uncompressed as XIP pages.  This allows for faster boot up and
	  application launch time with a smaller memory footprint.

	bool "First Mount AXFS as Rootfs"
	depends on AXFS
	help
	  Say Y if you have enabled axfs, and you want to mount the axfs
	  image as a root file system first when the kernel boots. This option
	  makes the kernel boottime a little faster when the command line is
	  properly set. Before having the kernel mount this axfs image
	  as a root file system, you must pass the command line parameter:
	  "root=/dev/null rootflags=physaddr=0x********" to the kernel
	  (replace 0x******** with the physical address location of the
	  axfs image to boot with).

	  If unsure, say N.
